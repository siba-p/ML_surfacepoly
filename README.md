# 🔬 Polymer-Surface PMF Prediction using *****

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the **Potential of Mean Force (PMF) profiles** of polymer-surface interactions using enhanced sampling data from Umbrella Sampling (US). The input to the neural network consists of **one-hot encoded polymer-surface representations** along with fractional compositions.

## 📌 **Project Overview**
In molecular simulations, **PMF profiles**.  Instead of running computationally expensive **umbrella sampling (US)** simulations for each polymer-surface combination, we train a neural network to predict the **full PMF profile** from encoded polymer and surface information.
